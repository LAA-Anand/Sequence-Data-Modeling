Computer vision is not just a way to convert pictures to pixels, and it can’t make sense of a picture just from its pixels. It’s the ability of a machine to take a step back and interpret the big picture that those pixels represent. And that’s much harder than we think it is.
For instance, when we see a picture of a model wearing a dress, we automatically identify which part of the body we’re looking at and from which angle. We can figure out lighting conditions. We may even be able to judge the color and texture of the clothes based on shadows, highlights and color temperature.
